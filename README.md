# Portfolio Static Site Structure

This is a minimal, maintainable, and responsive static website for Benoît Boidin's portfolio.

## Structure

- `/index.html` — Home page
- `/education.html` — Academic background
- `/experiences.html` — Professional experiences
- `/posts.html` — Articles/posts
- `/assets/`
  - `/css/style.css` — Main stylesheet
  - `/js/main.js` — Minimal JS (mobile menu)
  - `/img/` — Profile, logos, and other images
- `/documents/` — PDFs (CV, recommendations, etc.)

## Adding a New Page
1. Copy `index.html` and rename as `yourpage.html`.
2. Update the `<main>` content and the navigation links if needed.
3. Add your new page to the navigation in all HTML files for consistency.

## Responsive Design
- The site is fully responsive and mobile-first.
- Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on small screens.

## Customization
- Update `/assets/css/style.css` for style changes.
- Add images to `/assets/img/` and reference them with `/assets/img/yourimage.jpg`.
- Add new PDFs to `/documents/`.
