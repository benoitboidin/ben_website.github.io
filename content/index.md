# Benoit Boidin website

> Everything here is temporary. I just discovered `hugo` (the framework used to render this website), and I still need to automate the process of converting my Obsidian notes to make it work here.  
> I mainly did all this to show my mom I have a custom domain name (she doesn't know what it is, but she's proud of me).

## Overview

I'm studying data science and I am trying make a nice website about it.
I'll put there some corporate resume stuff, and some personal projects, notes and interesting items.  

I'll be happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/beno√Æt-boidin-276124a3), or [GitHub](https://github.com/benoitboidin) if you want to see my projects (not much for now). For collaboration, I started using [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/benoitboidin).

## Projects

The network I used the most is [yolox](/yolox). I implemented it during my internship at MaxSea International, in order to make it recognize boats.
