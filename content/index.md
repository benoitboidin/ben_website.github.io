## Overview

I'm studying data science and I am trying make a nice website about.
I'll put there some [corporate resume stuff](../assets/experiences), and some personal projects, notes and interesting items.  

I'll be happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/benoÃ®t-boidin-276124a3), or [GitHub](https://github.com/benoitboidin) if you want to see my projects (not much for now). For collaboration, I started using [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/benoitboidin).

## Projects

The network I used the most is [YOLOX](/yolox). I implemented it during my internship at MaxSea International, in order to make it recognize boats. During this internship, I worked with [COCO datasets](/coco_format) and visualized it with [FiftyOne](/fiftyone).

I'll put some other projects here, like keyword extraction:

> Some text with keywords blablabla **forest** blablabla **trees** blablabla...  
> -> And then the extracted keywords: **forest**, **trees**.

Also a `gif` of object detection with YOLOX would be cool, like boats and bounding boxes moving around.
