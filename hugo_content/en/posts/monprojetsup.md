✅ This algorithm is extremely helpful.

❌ However, [this paper](https://rschmacker.github.io/files/JMP.pdf) desmonstrate it's not enough.

Women and lower social class student tend to under estimate their competences.

The solution? [MonProjetSup](https://monprojetsup.fr) (Beta version).

This prototype is basically a personnalized search engine.

It allows student to esimate their chances of success thanks to metrics like last years admissions.

Why is this feedback needed? That's what I asked the paper authors.

Their response: information help reduce significatively the influence of self trust: 

- by 72 for gender inequality ; 
- by 95 for social inequality.
