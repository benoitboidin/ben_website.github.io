# I spent 6 months looking at boats...

(and I hope to find a job with that)  

✅ MaxSea International sells a marine surveillance software with camera management.

❌ What they don't sell is someone looking at the camera screens 24/7.
  
So here I came with some machine learning knowledge.

It took me 3 steps to solve their issue:

1. gather thousand of boat pictures ;
2. classify it with clustering ;
3. train a detection neural network.  

The result? Model precision augmented by 45%.

And it's real time (thanks to quantization).

I am know looking for a new opportunity to challenge me and bring my knowledge to an organisation that need innovation and teamm work.

Thanks to the MaxSea team for this collaboration!
