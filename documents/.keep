PDFs and images for the static site have been migrated from the old Hugo public folders to the new structure:

- All images are now in `/assets/img/` (including profile photos, logos, and project images).
- All PDFs are now in `/documents/` (CVs, recommendations, memoires, etc.).

Update your HTML references as follows:
- Images: `/assets/img/yourimage.jpg`
- PDFs: `/documents/yourfile.pdf`

This ensures a clean, maintainable, and portable static site structure.
